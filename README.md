In this project I will be creating a simple restaurant page.

Some goals for the project.
- Use webpack and npm
- Make a simple home, contact, menu page
- For the location try to display an interactive map.

#Outcome of the project.
Learned how to use module and have a little grasp about npm, still not very comfortable using it tho. My javascript code are much more organised thanks to modules. For future projects I would like to implement SASS to better structure my css code. In this project It was a struggle to organize my css code because it was very long and not well structured.
